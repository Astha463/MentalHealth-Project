Mental Health Awareness in Eating Disorders
This repository is dedicated to promoting mental health awareness, particularly focusing on the complexities of eating disorders. Here, you'll find a variety of resources, data, and tools aimed at understanding the psychological, physical, and emotional aspects of eating disorders, such as anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge-eating disorder. Our goal is to provide users with educational materials, support networks, and interactive tools to help in raising awareness and fostering a supportive environment. The resources in this repository include informative content, infographics, personal testimonials, and links to mental health organizations, designed to make understanding eating disorders accessible and empathetic.

The project also includes a sample mental health tracking tool that allows individuals to record mood, diet, and body image insights. This tool can serve as a foundation for creating customized tracking applications for users, therapists, and support groups to monitor progress and promote self-awareness. We encourage contributions to improve the project, whether through additional resources, code enhancements, or data visualization tools. Together, we can make a difference by fostering a deeper understanding of eating disorders and creating a more supportive, informed community.
