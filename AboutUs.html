Our Mission
</h1>  <p>
HappyMind advances the mental health and well-being of all people living in the Nepal through public education, research, advocacy and public policy, and direct service.
</p>
 

 <h2>HappyMind</h2>

<p>
HappyMind is the small nonprofit dedicated to the promotion of mental health, well-being, and illness prevention. <br/>
Our work is informed, designed, and led by the lived experience of those most affected.<br/>
Operating nationally and in communities across the country, HappyMind advocates for closing the mental health equity 
<br/>gap while increasing nationwide awareness and understanding through public education, direct services, tools, and research. <br/>
Our annual State of Mental Health in Nepal report is among the most widely respected health reports in the nation. <br/>
The new future of whole person's health, healing, and flourishing.<br/>

At HappyMind, we're not just dreaming of a better future—we're shaping it.<br/>

HappyMind aims to break free of existing limitations in our thinking and approach. We intend to think beyond short-term constraints, <br/>
misaligned incentives, and policy-making cycles—and ask ourselves how we would design a person-centered system with a focus on all aspects of health and healing.
