        <h2>OverView of Eating Disorder</h2>
        <p>

          An eating disorder is a mental health condition where you use the control of food to cope with feelings and other situations.
          
          Unhealthy eating behaviours may include eating too much or too little or worrying about your weight or body shape.
          
          Anyone can get an eating disorder, but teenagers and young adults are mostly affected.
          
          With treatment, most people can recover from an eating disorder.
        </p>          
        <h3>Symptoms</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>spending a lot of time worrying about your weight and body shape</li>
          <li>avoiding socialising when you think food will be involved</li>
          <li>eating very little food</li>
          <li>making yourself sick or taking laxatives after you eat</li>
          <li>exercising too much</li>
          <li>having very strict habits or routines around food</li> 
          <li>changes in your mood, such as being withdrawn, anxious or depressed</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What Causes Eating Disorder?</h3>
        <ul>
          
          
          
         
         
          <li>you or a member of your family has a history of eating disorders, depression, or alcohol or drug misuse</li>
          <li>you've been criticised for your eating habits, body shape or weight</li>
          <li>you're really worried about being slim, particularly if you also feel pressure from society or your job, for example, ballet dancers, models or athletes</li>
          <li> you have anxiety, low self-esteem, an obsessive personality or are a perfectionist</li>
          <li> you've been sexually abused</li>
          
        </ul>
        <h3>Treatment for eating disorders</h3>
       <p> You can recover from an eating disorder, but it may take time and recovery will be different for everyone.<p>
<p>
        If you're referred to an eating disorder specialist or team of specialists, they'll be responsible for your care.
</p>
        They should talk to you about the support you might need, such as for other conditions you have, and include this in your treatment plan.
        <p>
        Your treatment will depend on the type of eating disorder you have, but usually includes a talking therapy.
        </p>
        You may also need regular health checks if your eating disorder is having an impact on your physical health.
        <p>
        Your treatment may also involve working through a guided self-help programme if you have bulimia or binge eating disorder.
        </p>
        Most people will be offered individual therapy, but those with binge eating disorder may be offered group therapy.
        <p>
        Read more about the different treatments for:
      </p><ul>
          <li>anorexia</li>  
          <li>bulimia</li>   
           <li>binge eating disorder</li> 
          </ul>
        Treatment for other specified feeding or eating disorder (OSFED) will depend on the type of eating disorder your symptoms are most like.
        
        For example, if your symptoms are most like anorexia, your treatment will be similar to the treatment for anorexia.
